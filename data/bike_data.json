The wheels have had a slight upgrade for 2022, so you're now getting DT Swiss R470 rims with the Formula hubs.

      "description": "The WattBike is the best e-bike for people who still feel young at heart. It has a  Bafang 500 watt geared hub motor that can reach 20 miles per hour on both steep inclines and city streets. The lithium-ion battery, which gets nearly 40 miles per charge, has a lightweight form factor, making it easier for seniors to use. It comes fully assembled (no convoluted instructions!) and includes a sturdy helmet at no cost. The Plush saddle softens over time with use. The included Seatpost, however, is easily adjustable and adds to this bike’s fantastic rating for seniors, as do the hydraulic disc brakes from Tektro.",

From the ergonomic grips to the lumbar-supporting seat position, the Roll Low-Entry offers incredible comfort. The rear-inclined seat tube facilitates stability by allowing you to put a foot on the ground to balance at a stop, and the low step-over frame makes it accessible for all ability and mobility levels. The saddle is very soft, with a wide back to support your hip joints and a cutout in the center to redistribute that pressure. Rim brakes deliver satisfactory braking control, and the wide tires provide a smooth, stable ride on paved roads and gravel. Rack and fender mounts facilitate setting up the Roll Low-Entry as your preferred commuter, and the BMX-like handlebar offers space for mounting a flashlight, bell, or phone holder.",

This is the tiniest kids’ pedal bike on the market available without a coaster brake, the Jigger is the vehicle of choice for the rare tenacious little rider raring to go. We say rare because this smokin’ little bike is not ideal for a nervous first-time rider, but it’s a true giddy up for a true speedster. The Jigger is a 12 inch lightweight kids bicycle and it will meet your little one’s need for speed. It’s a single speed bike that makes learning to pump pedals simple and intuitive. It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight children’s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jigger’s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jigger’s is amazing on dirt or pavement.

      "description": "Kids want to ride with as little weight as possible. Especially on an incline! They may be at the age when a 27.5\" wheel bike is just too clumsy coming off a 24\" bike. The Hillcraft 26 is just the solution they need! Imagine 120mm travel. Boost front/rear.  You have NOTHING to tweak because it is easy to assemble right out of the box. The Hillcraft 26 is an efficient trail trekking machine. Up or down does not matter - dominate the trails going both down and up with this amazing bike. The name Monarch comes from Monarch trail in Colorado where we love to ride.  It’s a highly technical, steep and rocky trail but the rip on the waydown is so fulfilling.  Don’t ride the trail on a hardtail! It is so much more fun on the full suspension Hillcraft!  Hit your local trail with the Hillcraft Monarch 26 to get to where you want to go."

The 6061 alloy frame is triple-butted which ensures a lighter weight and smoother ride. And it’s comfortable with dropped seat stays and the carbon fork. The carefully crafted 50-34 tooth chainset and 11-32 tooth cassette give an easy-on-the-legs bottom gear for climbing, and the high-quality Vittoria Zaffiro tires balance grip, rolling friction and puncture protection when coasting down the other side."

It comes fully assembled (no convoluted instructions!) and includes a sturdy helmet at no cost. The Plush saddle softens over time with use. The included Seatpost, however, is easily adjustable and adds to this bike’s fantastic rating for seniors, as do the hydraulic disc brakes from Tektro."

The rear-inclined seat tube facilitates stability by allowing you to put a foot on the ground to balance at a stop, and the low step-over frame makes it accessible for all ability and mobility levels. The saddle is very soft, with a wide back to support your hip joints and a cutout in the center to redistribute that pressure. Rim brakes deliver satisfactory braking control, and the wide tires provide a smooth, stable ride on paved roads and gravel. Rack and fender mounts facilitate setting up the Roll Low-Entry as your preferred commuter, and the BMX-like handlebar offers space for mounting a flashlight, bell, or phone holder."
